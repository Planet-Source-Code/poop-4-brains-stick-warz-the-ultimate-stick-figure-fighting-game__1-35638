To make a new level simply add 4 things

open the gfx folder

1. a new back_sprite file
   draw it

2. a new back_mask file
   make it a mask of the sprite file

3. a new background file
   draw it (ie, sky, mountains, hills, lake)
   make sure it matches the theme of the sprite file

all with a number at the end that follows the sequence of numbers of the other files
then

4. goto levels.dat
   add new line with this format
   Name (name of level), Navigation Difficulty Level (ie, Very Easy, Easy, Hard, Very Hard)
